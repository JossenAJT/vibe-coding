# Project Specification

## 1. Background & Problem

**Who has this problem?** This relates to all BUs, especially Products and Marketing BU because they have many subscription and usage on a weekly/monthly basis.  

**Current situation:** Currently, we are using manual way to capture the usage. The direct person in charge have to open lark base and insert the usage on a weekly basis. This involves at least 13 BUs as they have to key in manually on a weekly basis just to make sure whatever their BU is spending does not exceed budget.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

**Success looks like:**
- [Measurable outcome 1 - weekly actual usage is below the budgetted usage based on the RM amount monthly approved budget
- [Measurable outcome 2] monthly actual RM amount vs approved monthly budget RM amount
